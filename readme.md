## CSCI2340 Bouncing Balls Homework Assignment

This project creates a bouncing balls using the Entity Component System design architecture. 

The project is built using python and pygame. To run the project, run the `main.py` file.

The program starts with an initial ball. You can drag the ball by moving the mouse cursor on top of the ball and holding the left mouse button down. To release the ball, release the left mouse button. 

### Future Features:
- Adding more balls by pressing the spacebar.
- Collisions between balls.
- Random forces to encourage ball interaction.
- Adding more shapes.

### Bugs:
- When moving the mouse too fast while dragging a ball, it lets go of the ball. 
    - This can be fixed by introducing a state system when dragging balls.
